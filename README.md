# ExecutiveSearchYaml
This code attempt with Claude. 
The purpose of the code is to extact the members of the Hospital executive leadership team from Ontario Hosptials (about 140)
This data will be used to monitor turnover in the executive teams over time. The data set wil also be linke to the Ontario Salary survey data in the future
The focus is on being as acurate as possible. 
the project is using webscrapping tools only and will generate patterns that can be used as guides to extract specific hospitals

Phase 1: Generic approach for ~80% of hospitals
  phase 1a,  get 30 hospitals configured and make a go no go on methods.
Phase 2: Configure the ~20% problematic hospitals individually
Phase 3: Handle edge cases as they come up

Issues:
Currently its clear there is signficant variation in how hosptials struture their webpages
