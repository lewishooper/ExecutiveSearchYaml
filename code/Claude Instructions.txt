I have updated the SESSION_LOG.MD,next_batch_template.yaml, and the enhanced_hospitals.yaml These are now in the Knowledge repository
An updated version of the QuickReferenceUpdated.docx is now in the knowledge repository. 
Note:  The working copy of enhance_hospitals.yaml is in my R environment.
I would like to follow this process for todays work. 
1) I will pick and attempt to debug hospitals. using the following tools which are in  the knowledge repository including:
	* The quick_test()
	* helper$analyze_hospital_structure(FAC, Name, url)
	* patternQuickReferrence.html and 
	* the resources we have created and are in the knowledge repository. 



2) I will use Claude when those tools aren't helping. At which point if relevant I will give you:
	a sample code element for the CEO,
	the current Yaml card for the hospital
	the results of the quick_test, 
	the results of the analyze_hospital_structure and,


3) If you need additional R code run to help debug please create the code and ask me to run it. 
4) if you believe the pattern_based_scraper.R needs to be changed please create the necessary changes and tell me where to put it. 
5) Do not create additional documentation without asking if I want that documentation created. 
6) our focus is on using and or amending existing patterns where possible. adding new patterns is a last resort

7) when passing a  yaml card for a hospital for trial the status should marked as follows:
    A) status: Needs Testing. 
    B) status:  missing_people.  only if we have added people through a missing people add on
