we are now in Phase 2 of the project which is focused on creating a single source of truth for recognzing executive names and titles. using the enhanced_hospitals.yaml file as the  source of truth
UPdated versions of the following documents with the suggested changes are now in the knowledge repository: 
   pattern_based_scrapper.r
   enhanced_hospitals.yaml
   test_all configured_hospitals.R (a change in working directory only)
   a number of docx files related to the phase 2 developent are also there as a reference.
Please review the above documents which are all in the repospitory

#Nov9 2025
A baseline document(nov 8) was created with the new software usign test_all_configure_hospitals, and it idnentified 399 executives but the older baseline document identified 1042
An Analhysis of the failures indicates that some patterns were successfully changed while others need to be debugged.

Based on the comparison of baselinedocuments from nov6 and nov 8
I would like to begin a process of debugging the pattern_based_scraper.R and the Enhanced_hospitals.yaml on a pattern by pattern basis
My working model will be to initially  pick patterns with the most failures and then give you a hospital that uses tha pattern as a starting point for debugging

Note:  The working copy of enhance_hospitals.yaml and pattern_based_scraper.R is in my R environment.
I would like to follow this process for todays work. 
1) I will pick and attempt to debug hospitals. using the following tools which are in  the knowledge repository including:
	* The quick_test()
	* helper$analyze_hospital_structure(FAC, Name, url)
	* patternQuickReferrence.html and 
	* the resources we have created and are in the knowledge repository. 



2) I will use Claude when those tools aren't helping. At which point if relevant I will give you:
	a sample code element for the CEO,
	the current Yaml card for the hospital
	the results of the quick_test, 
	the results of the analyze_hospital_structure


3) If you need additional R code run to help debug please create the code and ask me to run it. 

4) if you believe the pattern_based_scraper.R needs to be changed please create the necessary changes and tell me where to put it. 

5) Do not create additional documentation without asking if I want that documentation created. 

6) our focus is on using and or amending existing patterns where possible. adding new patterns is a last resort

7) when passing a  yaml card for a hospital for trial the status should marked as follows:
    A) status: Needs Testing. 
    B) status:  missing_people.  only if we have added people through a missing people add on
8) based on the project plan "Project Plan November 1 2025.docx" we will provide less emphasis on solving Missing people problems assuming:
    A) the pattern based scrapper process finds a significant majority of 4/5 of the executives
    B) This is based on the idea that we will be working on creating a  signle source of truth for names and titles in the next phase
9) I have created a log of   missing people that we can use when we start working on the single source of truth: see example below
FAC	Hospital	Name	Title	Pattern

All hospitals have now been processed. There are 7 hospitals who are blocked or closed

There are 123 hospitals where the pattern is working but some of those will need to be reviewed for missing people.
These can be dealt with as a part of the process of developing a single source of truth for exectuive names and titles
There are 9 hospitals that required debugging. This will be our focus for today
