Today we will continue to review the hospitals with missing persons to see if we  can improve recogniton
Yesterday we dealt with a number of a number of hospitasl with a  Combined_h2 pattern
I ran the test_all_configured Hospitals and Identified several where the expected counts differ from the actual.Many of these were addressed as counting issues.
However in one case errors have been idnentified. 
In those cases I find where there is an error that is intended to be pickedup or cleaned up in post processing I have marked the yamal status as ok-PP

In order to continue our debugging process

I will give you:
the FAC  to debug
a description of the error.
the yaml code for that FAC
a snippet of html code for the CEO
and the results of the quickTest
The working assumption is that changes to either the pattern_based_scraper.R and the enhanced_hospitals.yaml will be done in one of two ways.
1) The error correction is likely specific only to that hospital or has risks of untoward effects it will go into the # HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES (Phase 2 Addition)
2) but where possible and with minimum risk the changes should go into the general RECOGNITION CONFIGURATION (Phase 2 Addition) of the  yaml file.
 Does the above make sense?
 

in terms of workflow process. The pattern_based_scrape.r and the enhanced_hospitals.yaml code in the knowlege repostiory is current
however, the working copies of both files are in my R environment.
If we need to run code to debug please give me the code and I will run in my R environment
Please consult me before creating any supplemental documentation.
