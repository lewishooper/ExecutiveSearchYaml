Today we will continue to review the hospitals with missing persons to see if we  can improve recogniton
We are working through those hospitals who have missing persons and are  using the combined_h2 pattern. 4 in total

I will give you:
the FAC  to debug
the yaml code for that FAC
a snippet of html code for the CEO
and the results of the quickTest
Since the debug assumption is that the pattern chosen is correct
And the issue is name/title recogniton needs tuned Do you need the analysis of structure?
And is there any other data you will need?

in terms of workflow process. The pattern_based_scrape.r and the enhanced_hospitals.yaml code in the knowlege repostiory is current
however, the working copies of both files are in my R environment.
If we need to run code to debug please give me the code and I will run in my R environment
Please consult me before creating any supplemental documentation.
