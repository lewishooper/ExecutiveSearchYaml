pattern_identification_guide:
  questions_to_ask:
    - Where are the executive names located? (h1, h2, h3, p, div, span, td, li)
    - Where are the titles located? (same or different element type)
    - Are names and titles in the same element or separate?
    - If separate, what's the relationship? (next sibling, same parent, table row)
    - Are there any CSS classes that identify name/title elements?
    - Are executives in a specific section/container?
    - Are there any missing people not in the main structure?
  common_patterns_to_look_for:
    - h2 followed by h3 (name then title)
    - h2 followed by p (name then title)
    - Combined in h2 or h3 with separator (John Smith - CEO)
    - Table rows with name/title columns
    - Div or span classes (.name, .title, .staff-name, etc.)
    - List items with structured content
    - Card layouts with consistent structure
