    - "Where are the titles located? (same or different element type)"
    - "Are names and titles in the same element or separate?"
    - "If separate, what's the relationship? (next sibling, same parent, table row)"
    - "Are there any CSS classes that identify name/title elements?"
    - "Are executives in a specific section/container?"
    - "Are there any missing people not in the main structure?"
    
  common_patterns_to_look_for:
    - "h2 followed by h3 (name then title)"
    - "h2 followed by p (name then title)"
    - "Combined in h2 or h3 with separator (John Smith - CEO)"
    - "Table rows with name/title columns"
    - "Div or span classes (.name, .title, .staff-name, etc.)"
    - "List items with structured content"
    - "Card layouts with consistent structure"
