## Session History

### Session: 2025-10-13 AM - Accented Names Fix & Documentation Review
**Time:** 8:00 AM - 11:50 AM

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Fixed accented name recognition (FAC-932: Mélanie Dubé now auto-detected)
- ✅ Added Unicode-aware flexible pattern to enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- ✅ Reviewed project structure and file organization
- ✅ Moved all changed files to Claude repository and updated Git
- ✅ Verified all 34 configured hospitals still working
- ✅ Documented workflow for moving from next_batch_template.yaml to enhanced_hospitals.yaml

**Files Modified:**
- `enhanced_hospitals.yaml` - Added Unicode flexible pattern: `"^[A-ZÀ-ÖØ-Ýà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ][a-zà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ'-]+ [A-ZÀ-ÖØ-Ýà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ][a-zà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ'-]+$"`
- Removed Mélanie Dubé from FAC-932 missing_people (now auto-detected)

**Current Status:**
- Total configured hospitals: 34
- All 34 working and tested
- Accented name support now system-wide
- Ready to begin batch 2 configuration

**Key Learnings:**
- Unicode patterns in `flexible` section catch all accented names (French, Spanish, etc.)
- System now handles: José, François, Gisèle, André, Mélanie, etc.
- No need to manually add executives with accented names to missing_people

**Critical Workflow Note:**
- Need to establish clear process for moving hospitals from `next_batch_template.yaml` → `enhanced_hospitals.yaml`
- CRITICAL: Must not lose already configured hospitals when updating enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- Best practice: Test in next_batch_template.yaml, then append to enhanced_hospitals.yaml only after success

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate next_batch_template.yaml with next 30 hospitals
2. Establish and document workflow for testing → moving hospitals
3. Create backup strategy before batch updates
4. Begin systematic configuration of batch 2

**Issues/Blockers:**
- None - accented name issue resolved

**Time Spent:** ~3.8 hours

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### Configuration Tips
1. **Start with analyze_hospital_structure()** - Don't guess at patterns
2. **Look for similar hospitals** - If structure looks familiar, check if pattern exists
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't configure 10 before testing first one
4. **Use existing examples** - Copy/modify similar hospital configs

### Quality Control
1. **Verify expected_executives count** - Check website before setting
2. **Test immediately after configuring** - Catch errors early
3. **Check for duplicates** - System removes them but verify in output
4. **Spot check names/titles** - Ensure no garbage data captured

### Time Savers
1. Use `quick_test(FAC)` instead of full test suite during development
2. Only run `test_all_configured_hospitals()` after batch completion
3. Keep browser dev tools open for quick HTML inspection
4. Use helper's analyze function before manual inspection

### Critical Safety Rules
1. **NEVER overwrite enhanced_hospitals.yaml without backup**
2. **Test hospitals in next_batch_template.yaml first**
3. **Only move to enhanced_hospitals.yaml after successful test**
4. **Keep Git commits frequent during batch work**

## For Claude: Project Context

**When resuming this conversation:**
1. This is a multi-day R project for web scraping hospital executive data
2. We have 13 different scraping patterns documented in Hospital Scraper Pattern Registry.md
3. System uses YAML configuration files for each hospital
4. Currently ready to start batch 2 of 30 hospitals
5. User is experienced with R, familiar with the codebase
6. All code is in E:/ExecutiveSearchYaml/code/
7. Main working file: enhanced_hospitals.yaml (DO NOT OVERWRITE!)
8. Testing file: next_batch_template.yaml (safe to experiment)
9. User will upload updated files at start of each session

**Key user preferences:**
- Prefers efficient, systematic workflows
- Values documentation and organization
- Likes to test incrementally
- Wants clear checklists and progress tracking
- Concerned about data safety (never lose configured hospitals)

**Communication style:**
- Technical and direct
- Appreciates detailed explanations when needed
- Prefers working code over lengthy discussion
- Values practical solutions

**Recent Fixes:**
- Accented names (é, à, ô, etc.) now work system-wide via Unicode flexible pattern
- FAC-932 (Elizabeth Bruyère) working without manual entry
- All 34 hospitals tested and passing

**Next Review:** Start of next session (batch 2 configuration)

### Session: 2025-10-13 PM - Workflow Simplification

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Identified issue with FAC-665 (Guelph General) - names rejected due to missing name_patterns in next_batch
- ✅ Discovered root cause: test_next_batch.R only reads next_batch_template.yaml (missing global patterns)
- ✅ **KEY INSIGHT:** Realized two-file workflow is unnecessarily complex
- ✅ Simplified workflow: Work directly in enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- ✅ Updated all workflow documentation to reflect simpler approach
- ✅ Deprecated merge scripts (test_next_batch.R, merge_tested_to_enhanced.R)

**Major Workflow Change:**

**OLD (Complex):**
1. Configure in next_batch_template.yaml
2. Test with test_next_batch.R (missing patterns)
3. Merge to enhanced_hospitals.yaml
4. Sync name_patterns between files
5. Hope nothing breaks

**NEW (Simple):**
1. Use next_batch_template.yaml as reference list only
2. Configure directly in enhanced_hospitals.yaml
3. Test with quick_test(FAC) - all patterns available
4. Mark done in Excel
5. Done!

**Files Updated:**
- SIMPLIFIED_WORKFLOW.md (complete rewrite)
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (updated for new workflow)

**Files Deprecated (but kept for reference):**
- test_next_batch.R (not needed)
- merge_tested_to_enhanced.R (not needed)
- compare_yaml_status.R (not needed)
- Next Batch Testing Workflow.md (outdated)

**FAC-665 Resolution:**
- Issue: Separator was "," not "-", and name_patterns missing from next_batch
- Solution: Add to enhanced_hospitals.yaml with correct separator
- Pattern: combined_h2 with separator: ", "

**Current Status:**
- Total configured hospitals: 34 in enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- FAC-665: Ready to configure using simplified workflow
- Batch approach: Use next_batch as TODO list, work in enhanced file

**Key Learning:**
Don't maintain configs in two places! Use next_batch_template.yaml as a reference/tracking list, but do all configuration and testing directly in enhanced_hospitals.yaml.

**Benefits of New Workflow:**
- Single source of truth
- All name_patterns available immediately
- No syncing issues
- Simpler, faster, fewer errors
- Familiar commands (quick_test)

**Next Steps:**
1. Add FAC-665 to enhanced_hospitals.yaml
2. Test with quick_test(665)
3. Continue with remaining hospitals using simplified workflow
4. Use next_batch_template.yaml as reference only

**Issues/Blockers:**
- None - workflow simplified and clearer

**Time Spent:** ~1.5 hours

---

**Updated Documentation:**
- SIMPLIFIED_WORKFLOW.md - Complete guide to new workflow
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Updated commands and process
- Session log updated with workflow change rationale

**User Feedback:**
User correctly identified that maintaining configs in two files was inefficient and error-prone. The suggestion to work directly in enhanced_hospitals.yaml was adopted as the new standard workflow.

### Session: 2025-10-16 PM - FAC-736, 745, 763 Configuration

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Configured FAC-736 (Southlake) - div_classes with tm-name/tm-primary-title
- ✅ Fixed "Charmaine van Schaik, MD" name pattern issue
- ✅ Added pattern for lowercase "van" with credentials
- ✅ Configured FAC-745 (Orillia) - div_classes with name/position classes
- ✅ Configured FAC-763 (Pembroke) - manual_entry_required (prose titles)
- ✅ Clarified `missing_people` vs `manual_entry_required` usage
- ✅ Created comprehensive FUTURE_WORK.md documentation
- ✅ Created tracking spreadsheet structure

**Files Modified:**
- enhanced_hospitals.yaml - Added FAC-736, 745, 763
- name_patterns - Added `^[A-Z][a-z]+ van [A-Z][a-z]+, [A-Z]{2,}$`
- Created FUTURE_WORK.md

**Current Status:**
- Total configured hospitals: 38 (35 + 3 new)
- Pattern distribution: All 13 patterns in use
- Manual entry hospitals: 4 (acceptable threshold)

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Container_class in div_classes:** Start without it, only add if mis-pairing occurs
2. **CSS class names:** Always verify actual class names (e.g., "position" not "title")
3. **missing_people vs manual_entry:** Use missing_people when pattern works but misses a few; use manual_entry when pattern completely fails
4. **Pattern development threshold:** Need 5+ hospitals before justifying new pattern

**Pattern Issues Documented:**
- Category 1 (Name patterns): ~7 hospitals - HIGH priority
- Category 2 (Prose titles): 1 hospital - LOW priority  
- Category 3 (JavaScript): 4 hospitals - MEDIUM priority
- Category 4 (New structures): 0 hospitals - OK

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue with next batch hospitals
2. Review name_patterns at 50 hospital milestone
3. Quarterly review of manual entry hospitals
4. Track similar patterns for future development

**Issues/Blockers:**
- None currently

**Time Spent:** ~2 hours
