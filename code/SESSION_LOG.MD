## Session History

### Session: 2025-10-13 AM - Accented Names Fix & Documentation Review
**Time:** 8:00 AM - 11:50 AM

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Fixed accented name recognition (FAC-932: Mélanie Dubé now auto-detected)
- ✅ Added Unicode-aware flexible pattern to enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- ✅ Reviewed project structure and file organization
- ✅ Moved all changed files to Claude repository and updated Git
- ✅ Verified all 34 configured hospitals still working
- ✅ Documented workflow for moving from next_batch_template.yaml to enhanced_hospitals.yaml

**Files Modified:**
- `enhanced_hospitals.yaml` - Added Unicode flexible pattern: `"^[A-ZÀ-ÖØ-Ýà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ][a-zà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ'-]+ [A-ZÀ-ÖØ-Ýà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ][a-zà-öø-ýĀ-žḀ-ỿ'-]+$"`
- Removed Mélanie Dubé from FAC-932 missing_people (now auto-detected)

**Current Status:**
- Total configured hospitals: 34
- All 34 working and tested
- Accented name support now system-wide
- Ready to begin batch 2 configuration

**Key Learnings:**
- Unicode patterns in `flexible` section catch all accented names (French, Spanish, etc.)
- System now handles: José, François, Gisèle, André, Mélanie, etc.
- No need to manually add executives with accented names to missing_people

**Critical Workflow Note:**
- Need to establish clear process for moving hospitals from `next_batch_template.yaml` → `enhanced_hospitals.yaml`
- CRITICAL: Must not lose already configured hospitals when updating enhanced_hospitals.yaml
- Best practice: Test in next_batch_template.yaml, then append to enhanced_hospitals.yaml only after success

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate next_batch_template.yaml with next 30 hospitals
2. Establish and document workflow for testing → moving hospitals
3. Create backup strategy before batch updates
4. Begin systematic configuration of batch 2

**Issues/Blockers:**
- None - accented name issue resolved

**Time Spent:** ~3.8 hours

### Session: 2025-01-08 PM - Environment Setup
**Goals for this session:**
- Organize workflow for smooth daily startup
- Create session management system
- Document best practices

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive SESSION_LOG.md
- ✅ Created startup/shutdown scripts
- ✅ Documented file update workflow
- ✅ Created project status dashboard script

**Files Modified:**
- Created `SESSION_LOG.md`
- Created `session_startup.R`
- Created `session_shutdown.R`
- Created `project_status.R`

**Next Session Starts With:**
1. Upload updated files to Claude
2. Run `source("session_startup.R")`
3. Begin configuring batch 2 hospitals

---

### Session: 2025-01-08 AM - Template Generator Fix
**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Fixed `generate_yaml_template.R` to work with Excel columns (FAC, Hospital, url, done)
- ✅ Generated `next_batch_template.yaml` with 30 hospitals
- ✅ Verified all scripts working correctly
- ✅ All cleanup complete, files moved to Git

**Current Status:**
- Have `next_batch_template.yaml` with 30 hospitals ready to configure
- All tools tested and working
- Ready to start systematic configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `generate_yaml_template.R` - Fixed column detection for FAC, Hospital, url, done
- Created `diagnose_excel_columns.R` - Diagnostic tool
- Generated `next_batch_template.yaml`

**Key Learnings:**
- Excel file structure: FAC (numeric), Hospital (char), url (char), done (char)
- Need exact column name matching in scripts
- Template generator successfully identifies which hospitals need URLs

### Session: 2025-01-07 - Initial Development
**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ Created 13-pattern scraping system
- ✅ Built comprehensive Pattern Registry documentation
- ✅ Configured and tested first 27 hospitals
- ✅ All initial tests passing
- ✅ Created helper tools and testing suite

**Key Files Created:**
- `pattern_based_scraper.R` - Main scraper with 13 patterns
- `enhanced_hospitals.yaml` - Configuration for hospitals
- `quick_test_single.R` - Single hospital testing
- `test_all_configured_hospitals.R` - Batch testing
- `hospital_configuration_helper.R` - Analysis tools
- `Hospital Scraper Pattern Registry.md` - Complete pattern documentation
- `Hospital Configuration Workflow Guide.md` - Step-by-step guide

**Patterns Implemented:**
1. h2_name_h3_title - Sequential different elements
2. combined_h2 - Name+title in same element
3. table_rows - Table structure
4. h2_name_p_title - H2→P pattern
5. div_classes - CSS class-based
6. list_items - List with separators
7. boardcard_gallery - Card layouts
8. custom_table_nested - Complex nested tables
9. field_content_sequential - Same-class repeating
10. nested_list_with_ids - ID-based pairing
11. qch_mixed_tables - Mixed table formats
12. p_with_bold_and_br - Bold names with BR separator
13. manual_entry - For blocked sites

**Initial Hospitals Configured:**
- FAC 707, 624, 596 - Pattern 1
- FAC 941, 952, 619, 970 - Pattern 2
- FAC 661, 781 - Pattern 3
- FAC 953, 632, 932 - Pattern 4

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### Configuration Tips
1. **Start with analyze_hospital_structure()** - Don't guess at patterns
2. **Look for similar hospitals** - If structure looks familiar, check if pattern exists
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't configure 10 before testing first one
4. **Use existing examples** - Copy/modify similar hospital configs

### Quality Control
1. **Verify expected_executives count** - Check website before setting
2. **Test immediately after configuring** - Catch errors early
3. **Check for duplicates** - System removes them but verify in output
4. **Spot check names/titles** - Ensure no garbage data captured

### Time Savers
1. Use `quick_test(FAC)` instead of full test suite during development
2. Only run `test_all_configured_hospitals()` after batch completion
3. Keep browser dev tools open for quick HTML inspection
4. Use helper's analyze function before manual inspection

### Critical Safety Rules
1. **NEVER overwrite enhanced_hospitals.yaml without backup**
2. **Test hospitals in next_batch_template.yaml first**
3. **Only move to enhanced_hospitals.yaml after successful test**
4. **Keep Git commits frequent during batch work**

## For Claude: Project Context

**When resuming this conversation:**
1. This is a multi-day R project for web scraping hospital executive data
2. We have 13 different scraping patterns documented in Hospital Scraper Pattern Registry.md
3. System uses YAML configuration files for each hospital
4. Currently ready to start batch 2 of 30 hospitals
5. User is experienced with R, familiar with the codebase
6. All code is in E:/ExecutiveSearchYaml/code/
7. Main working file: enhanced_hospitals.yaml (DO NOT OVERWRITE!)
8. Testing file: next_batch_template.yaml (safe to experiment)
9. User will upload updated files at start of each session

**Key user preferences:**
- Prefers efficient, systematic workflows
- Values documentation and organization
- Likes to test incrementally
- Wants clear checklists and progress tracking
- Concerned about data safety (never lose configured hospitals)

**Communication style:**
- Technical and direct
- Appreciates detailed explanations when needed
- Prefers working code over lengthy discussion
- Values practical solutions

**Recent Fixes:**
- Accented names (é, à, ô, etc.) now work system-wide via Unicode flexible pattern
- FAC-932 (Elizabeth Bruyère) working without manual entry
- All 34 hospitals tested and passing
